            <h1>What is Domestic Violence?</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Domestic violence (also called domestic abuse or family violence) is violence or other abuse that occurs  
            in a domestic setting, such as in a marriage or cohabitation. Domestic violence is often used as a synonym for 
            intimate partner violence, which is committed by one of the people in an intimate relationship against the other 
            person, and can take place in relationships or between former spouses or partners. In its broadest sense, 
            domestic violence also involves violence against children, parents, or the elderly. It can assume multiple forms, 
            including physical, verbal, emotional, economic, religious, reproductive, or sexual abuse. 
            It can range from subtle, coercive forms to marital rape and other violent physical abuse, 
            such as choking, beating, female genital mutilation, and acid throwing that may result in disfigurement or death, and 
            includes the use of technology to harass, control, monitor, stalk or hack. 
            Domestic murder includes stoning, bride burning, honor killing, and dowry death, which sometimes involves 
            non-cohabitating family members.</p>

            <h1>Acts & Laws against Domestic Violence</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Many laws were enacted to curb domestic violence beginning with Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 
                which made the act of giving and receiving dowry a crime. To further strengthen this law 
                two new sections section 498 A and section 304 B were introduced into the Indian Penal Code 
                (IPC) in 1983 and 1986. The most recent law is the Protection of Women from Domestic 
                Violence Act (PWDVA) 2005, a civil Law which broadened the definition of domestic violence 
                to include physical, emotional, sexual, verbal and economic violence as we know it today. 
                Other Acts include The Commission of Sati (Prevention) Act, 1987, Protection of Women from 
                Domestic Violence Act, 2005, Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956, The Prohibition of 
                Child Marriage Act, 2006, Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929, etc.</p>
