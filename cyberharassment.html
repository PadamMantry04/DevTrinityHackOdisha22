            <h1>What is Cyber Harassment?</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Cyberharassment is a form of bullying or harassment using electronic means. 
                Cyberbullying and cyberharassment are also known as online bullying. 
                It has become increasingly common, especially among teenagers, as the 
                digital sphere has expanded and technology has advanced. Cyberbullying 
                is when someone bullies or harasses others on the internet and other 
                digital spaces, particularly on social media sites. Harmful bullying 
                behavior can include posting rumors, threats, sexual remarks, a victims' 
                personal information, or pejorative labels (i.e. hate speech). Bullying 
                or harassment can be identified by repeated behavior and an intent to 
                harm. Victims of cyberbullying may experience lower self-esteem, 
                increased suicidal ideation, and various negative emotional responses, 
                including being scared, frustrated, angry, or depressed.</p>

            <h1>Acts & Laws against Cyber Harassment</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Cyber laws are contained in the Information Technology Act, 2000 
                (“IT Act”) which came into force on October 17, 2000. Section 
                66E of the IT Act deals with the violation of the privacy of a 
                person. Capturing, publishing or transmitting the image of a 
                private area of any person without consent, under circumstances 
                violating her privacy, is punishable with imprisonment, which 
                may extend to three years, and/or fine. The Indecent Representation
                of Women (Prohibition) Act, 1986 also protects women from Cyber crimes.</p>
